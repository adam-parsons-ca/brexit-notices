            <p>The airline might give you vouchers to get these things at the airport. Ask someone who works for the
              airline if you’re not offered anything.</p>
            <p>If they don’t give you help at the airport, keep receipts for your expenses and try to claim from the
              airline later. Airlines only pay for ‘reasonable’ expenses - you are unlikely to get money back for
              alcohol, expensive meals or luxury hotels.</p>

            <p>Contact the airline – this needs to be the airline operating the flight, even if you booked it through
              another airline. The airline’s customer services department will usually help. Be ready to give all your
              flight details and booking reference numbers.</p>
            <p>Write your claim – say what went wrong and what you want the airline to give you. The Civil Aviation
              Authority has information about how to write a good claim and you can download a template letter from the
              Which? website. Include copies (not originals) of your tickets and any receipts.</p>
            <p>Keep records – keep copies of your claim and any response from the airline. Take notes if you speak to
              anyone from the airline - this could be useful if you decide to take your claim further.</p>
