# CADS prototyping kit

Simple prototyping kit to get started, making use of the Citizens Advice Design System.

## Prerquisites

- Python 2
- Install NodeJS & NPM

## Structure

- Your CSS is located in the `styles` directory,
- The Javascript is housed within `scripts/app.js`, it's not minified or compiled in any way. It's up to you to manage this currently.
- Your views / pages can live happily in the directory root.

## Getting started

### Step 1

`$ npm install`

### Step 2

`$ npm run start`
Will start the server on [localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000)

### Step 3 (optional)

Open up a new terminal window and run:
`$ npm run watch:css`
This will compile your Sass styling for you.
