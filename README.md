# CADS prototyping kit

Simple prototyping kit to get started, making use of the Citizens Advice Design System.

## Getting started

The Javascript is housed within `scripts/app.js`, it's not minified or compiled in any way. It's up to you to manage this currently.

- `$ npm run start` - Will start the server on [localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000)
- `$ npm compileCSS` - Will compile your `sass` styling for you, feel free to shape this how you'd like in the `styles` directory.
